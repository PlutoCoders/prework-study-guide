        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, such as metadata.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Metadata examples for head: title, style, base, link, meta, script.</li>
          <li>p is for your paragraphs, ui for unordered lists, ol for ordered lists, li for list items.  </li>
          <li>img for images, src (attribute) for defined location of image, alt for explaining the image.</li>
          <li>br is a line break to create space between two blocks of code.</li>
          <li>a href=link where a is for an anchor which creates links, href is the url for the link.</li>
          <li>header appears at the top and usually contains navigational/introductory content.</li>
          <li>h1 to h6 are headings, to be used in order, where h1 is used once per page, and the others are used after. (Each header gets smaller.)</li>
          <li>footer at the bottom of the page, contains navigation, copyright, sitemap, contact, etc. In our case we have a note.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.
            When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a &lt;link&gt; element placed in the HTML's &lt;head&gt;, as shown in the following code:
              &lt;head&gt;
                &lt; rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" /&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
          </li>
          <li>margin: 40px auto; (use ; to add more stlying), assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element. ex/ padding: 10px 50x; </li>
          <li>A period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>width: 80% = Width of the element at 80% of the available width</li>
          <li>border: 5px solid gray = assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.</li>
          <li>selector (property; value) </li>
          <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Define a variable: var myVariableNameHere = "StringValue, or really any value you want here." </li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>You have to define what you want to alter/mess with before you alter/mess with it. (Control Flow)</li>
          <li>Arrays are like variables, in that they are boxes that store things, but they store way more things.</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful because you can grab/utilize the objects/things inside of it easy, as each value inside of it is assigned an integer. (Starting from 0 for the first, going up by 1, so 1 = the second array item)</li>
          <li>You can loop through an array to find variables or mess with them. (Such as with using a "for loop")</li>
          <li>Setting up a for loop example: (var x = 0; x < topics.length; x++) :First part defines the array you are going through and where its starting the count, next it checks for when the loop will stop, finally, it checks by what value it will count as it goes through the array. Default = 1.</li>
          <li>Functions are kind of like variables, in that they store something, but in this case its an action that you'll define.</li>
          <li>Create a function: function myFunctionNameHere() {the body/code of your function/what it does}</li>
          <li>In order to use your function, you have to call it, for example: myFunctionNameHere() </li>
          <li>If Then values are very useful to have in a function, because it can allow you to do more thna just one thing. It can allow you to check for other circumstances depending on what is truthy or falsy.</li>
