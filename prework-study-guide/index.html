        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, such as metadata.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Metadata examples for head: title, style, base, link, meta, script.</li>
          <li>p is for your paragraphs, ui for unordered lists, ol for ordered lists, li for list items.  </li>
          <li>img for images, src (attribute) for defined location of image, alt for explaining the image.</li>
          <li>br is a line break to create space between two blocks of code.</li>
          <li>a href=link where a is for an anchor which creates links, href is the url for the link.</li>
          <li>header appears at the top and usually contains navigational/introductory content.</li>
          <li>h1 to h6 are headings, to be used in order, where h1 is used once per page, and the others are used after. (Each header gets smaller.)</li>
          <li>footer at the bottom of the page, contains navigation, copyright, sitemap, contact, etc. In our case we have a note.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.
            When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a &lt;link&gt; element placed in the HTML's &lt;head&gt;, as shown in the following code:
              &lt;head&gt;
                &lt; rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" /&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
          </li>
          <li>margin: 40px auto; (use ; to add more stlying), assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element. ex/ padding: 10px 50x; </li>
          <li>A period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>width: 80% = Width of the element at 80% of the available width</li>
          <li>border: 5px solid gray = assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.</li>
          <li>selector (property; value) </li>
          <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
