# Pre-Course Frankenstein's Monstrosity of a Study Guide

## Description

- Going through a coding bootcamp for better career prospects and to utilize my creative abilities. The best way to get good at something with as much new information as this is to have study guides and well organized notes that you can always refer to.
|
- The goal of this project is to provide some of those organized notes, and serve as a playground/guinea pig for future updates and ideas.

- In making this project, I learned that at first, things can see quite daunting. But if you stick with it a little, you'll start to see that anything can be learned. Where there is a will, there is a way.

- With that said, its all still pretty daunting, but there is a will, so there must be way!

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

- The best way to install this project is to type the url into the search bar or click a link that you receive which opens the browser website up. (:
- Maybe there is a way to do it through github, but for now, beggers can't be choosers!

## Usage
- There are about 5 sections for certain topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Issues (Issues I was having/thinking about)

- You can open DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running behind the scenes.
(Open via: Right click, press inspect element, look around for a button that says output, click it, then look for some lines of text to popup saying cody stuff!)

- I tried to make the words in here commented out so that you can't see them. 
- Lets just hope that you can't see them.

## Credits

I'd like to thank my Mom for signing me up for the course.

Although the course instructions provided everything we needed, I did at times just look up a quick youtube video or internet search instead of trying to find specific notes in some page somewhere. (Which also made me realize I need to take more organized notes, as i'll be needing them.)

## License

I chose the MIT liscence, what will you choose?!?!
